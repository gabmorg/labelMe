Description:A Shiny webapp template customizable by user-facing functions outlined in the vignettes.
             This package is made for the creation of a tool to support the manual labeling workflow
             required by image-based algorithms in clinical settings, like ultrasound labeling, for example. 
             The package produces a locally hosted Shiny webapp thatâ€™s study and image-type agnostic. 
             This is done by functions for image upload and label organization, creation, and tracking. 
             The CSV output of labeling tasks will allow for text-based consensus testing between labelers.
