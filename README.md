# 1 About this package:

## 1.1 What it is ...
`labelMe` is a package allowing clinicians with ultrasound image data that requires manual labeling to easy spin up a webapp to do so. This is particularly useful to those who work with image labeling or recognition algorithms.

&nbsp;

## 1.2 How it works ...

**Organize your imaging files in a single directory with subdirectories for each patient, and within those subdirectories for each visit. Then, install the package, use its functions to set your desired labels and image repository filepath, and run your webapp locally!**
