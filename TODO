TO DO in package:
- function testing code
- Vignette folder (check if needed for the 4th)
- update Imports list
- put devtools::install_github("gabmorg/labelMe") on discussion board
- review expectations slides from class for more to dos


- delete /dev directory or add to gitignore for the 4th
The `./dev` directory. I use this directory to keep all files and assets that I need for development, but that should not be included and distributed in the final package. The directory is mentioned in `.Rbuildignore`. In `rpt` it contains `./dev/functionTemplate.R`, a template file for writing R functions with a Roxygen2 header, and `./dev/rptTwee.R`, which was discussed above.
